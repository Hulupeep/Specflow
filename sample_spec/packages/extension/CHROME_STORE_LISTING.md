## Extension Name
chat2repo

## Short Description (132 chars max)
Your best ChatGPT insights are buried under thousands of chats. One click saves any message to GitHub as searchable markdown. Private.

## Detailed Description

### Your Knowledge Is Buried

You've had thousands of valuable conversations with ChatGPT. Debugging breakthroughs. Explanations that finally clicked. Architecture decisions. Process improvements. Ideas you refined.

It's all still there — buried under thousands of other chats. Unsearchable. Unfindable. An invisible wiki that only exists in your chat history.

**Your runbook shouldn't be hidden in a chat log.**

chat2repo turns your best ChatGPT conversations into a searchable, permanent knowledge base in your GitHub repository.

### One Click. That's It.

1. Hover over any ChatGPT message
2. Click the button
3. It's in your GitHub repo as a clean markdown file

No copy-paste. No switching apps. No friction.

### Why GitHub?

Your notes become:
- **Searchable** — by grep, GitHub, your IDE, and AI coding assistants
- **Accessible to AI** — Claude Code and Copilot can read your repos
- **Version controlled** — see how your knowledge evolves
- **Truly yours** — plain markdown files, no vendor lock-in
- **Permanent** — no subscription fees, no shutdown risk

### What People Use It For

**Developers** — Capture debugging sessions, architecture decisions, that explanation of why the code works this way

**Researchers** — Build a searchable reference library from AI conversations

**Writers** — Save ideas, style decisions, research threads

**Teams** — Turn tribal knowledge into documentation that lives in your codebase

### What Gets Saved

```markdown
---
source: chatgpt
captured_at: 2025-12-03T10:30:00Z
url: https://chatgpt.com/c/...
tags:
  - chatgpt
  - debugging
  - api-design
---

Your captured message here...
```

Files are auto-organized: `chat-notes/2025/12/03/your-topic.md`

**Hashtag magic:** Include `#tags` anywhere in your content — they're automatically extracted and added to your note's metadata. Just ask ChatGPT: "Summarize this #debugging #react" and those tags are captured.

Compatible with Obsidian, Logseq, and any markdown tool.
