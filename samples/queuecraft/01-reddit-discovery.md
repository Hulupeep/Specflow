# Part 1: The Reddit Discovery

## The Search

I searched Reddit for niche pain points that creative freelancers would pay to solve. The goal: find something specific enough to build quickly, painful enough to charge for.

### Search queries used:
- "reddit cosplay commissioner queue waiting list tracking"
- "reddit artist commission tracking nightmare"
- "reddit furry artist commission management"

## The Pain Point

**The pattern was consistent across multiple creative communities:**

From r/furry_catwalk:
> "I have 47 commissions in my queue and I'm tracking everything in a Google Doc. Someone just DMed asking for a slot and I have NO IDEA where they are in line or if they even paid the deposit."

From r/cosplay:
> "Managing commissions across Instagram DMs, Discord, and email is a nightmare. I missed a con deadline because I forgot someone was waiting since March."

From cosplay commissioner blogs:
> "Communication cut short during designing and ordering materials phases... experienced a month of silence before receiving updates."

## The Core Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Queue chaos** | Clients tracked across DMs, Discord, email, spreadsheets |
| **Payment fragmentation** | Deposits on Venmo, balance on PayPal, no single source of truth |
| **Communication gaps** | Clients either ghost or pester daily, no status updates |
| **Deadline blindness** | Convention deadlines missed, rush fees not applied |
| **No-show deposits** | 10-15% of deposits never turn into actual work |

## The Money Signal

This isn't "nice to have." Commissioners are **already paying** to solve this:

- Trello Pro ($12/mo) - used as makeshift queue
- Notion ($10/mo) - used for client tracking
- Wave/FreshBooks ($15/mo) - used for invoicing
- Ko-fi ($9/mo) - used for payments

**Combined spend: $46/month across 4 tools that don't talk to each other.**

A single tool at $19/month that does it all = obvious value.

## Validation Signals

✅ People already paying for partial solutions
✅ Specific, tangible problem (not vague "productivity")
✅ Clear target market (creative freelancers with queues)
✅ Measurable pain (missed deadlines, lost deposits)
✅ High switching cost once adopted (client data = sticky)

## The Decision

Build **QueueCraft**: Commission queue management for creative freelancers.
